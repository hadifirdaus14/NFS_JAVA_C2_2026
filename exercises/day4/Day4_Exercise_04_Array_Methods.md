# Day 4 Exercise 04 - Practise JavaScript Array Methods

## What You Just Learned

The trainer showed several common JavaScript array methods using course data.

In this exercise, you will practise **8 JavaScript array methods** using student data:

```text
forEach
filter
find
map
push
pop
shift
unshift
```

Some of these methods are used to **read or transform** an array.

Some of these methods are used to **modify** the original array.

---

## Learning Objective

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

1. Loop through an array using `forEach`.
2. Filter records using `filter`.
3. Find one record using `find`.
4. Transform array data using `map`.
5. Add items to the end of an array using `push`.
6. Remove items from the end of an array using `pop`.
7. Remove items from the beginning of an array using `shift`.
8. Add items to the beginning of an array using `unshift`.

---

## Your Task

Create a file:

```text
student-array-methods.js
```

Inside the file, create the following array:

```javascript
const students = [
  { studentId: "S001", studentName: "Ignacio de Paul", email: "ignacio@example.com", status: "Active" },
  { studentId: "S002", studentName: "Ben Tan", email: "ben@example.com", status: "Inactive" },
  { studentId: "S003", studentName: "Chong Mei", email: "mei@example.com", status: "Active" }
];
```

Then complete all 8 coding tasks below.

---

# Part A - Methods That Read or Create a New Array

These methods do **not directly change** the original array:

```text
forEach
filter
find
map
```

---

## 1. forEach

Use `forEach` to print all student names.

Example:

```javascript
students.forEach((student) => {
  console.log(student.studentName);
});
```

Expected section title:

```text
=== All Student Names ===
```

---

## 2. filter

Use `filter` to create a new array containing only students whose status is `"Active"`.

Store the result in a variable called:

```javascript
activeStudents
```

Example output section title:

```text
=== Active Students ===
```

---

## 3. find

Use `find` to find the student with ID:

```text
S002
```

Store the result in a variable called:

```javascript
foundStudent
```

Example output section title:

```text
=== Find Student S002 ===
```

---

## 4. map

Use `map` to create a new array containing only student email addresses.

Store the result in a variable called:

```javascript
studentEmails
```

Example output section title:

```text
=== Student Emails ===
```

---

# Part B - Methods That Modify the Original Array

These methods **change the original array**:

```text
push
pop
shift
unshift
```

For this section, print the array after each operation so you can see how the data changes.

---

## 5. push

Use `push` to add one new student to the **end** of the array.

Add this student:

```javascript
{
  studentId: "S004",
  studentName: "Danish Nawaz",
  email: "danish@example.com",
  status: "Active"
}
```

Store the return value of `push` in a variable called:

```javascript
newLengthAfterPush
```

Then print:

```text
=== After push ===
```

Also print the new length.

---

## 6. pop

Use `pop` to remove the **last student** from the array.

Store the removed student in a variable called:

```javascript
removedLastStudent
```

Then print:

```text
=== After pop ===
```

Also print:

```text
Removed last student:
```

---

## 7. unshift

Use `unshift` to add one new student to the **beginning** of the array.

Add this student:

```javascript
{
  studentId: "S000",
  studentName: "Ignacio de Paul",
  email: "ignacio@example.com",
  status: "Active"
}
```

Store the return value of `unshift` in a variable called:

```javascript
newLengthAfterUnshift
```

Then print:

```text
=== After unshift ===
```

Also print the new length.

---

## 8. shift

Use `shift` to remove the **first student** from the array.

Store the removed student in a variable called:

```javascript
removedFirstStudent
```

Then print:

```text
=== After shift ===
```

Also print:

```text
Removed first student:
```

---

# Example Output

Your output does not need to look exactly the same, but it should contain all these sections:

```text
=== Original Students ===
[ ... ]

=== All Student Names ===
Ignacio de Paul
Ben Tan
Chong Mei

=== Active Students ===
[ ... ]

=== Find Student S002 ===
{ studentId: 'S002', studentName: 'Ben Tan', ... }

=== Student Emails ===
[ 'ignacio@example.com', 'ben@example.com', 'mei@example.com' ]

=== After push ===
[ ... ]
New length after push: 4

=== After pop ===
[ ... ]
Removed last student:
{ studentId: 'S004', studentName: 'Danish Nawaz', ... }

=== After unshift ===
[ ... ]
New length after unshift: 4

=== After shift ===
[ ... ]
Removed first student:
{ studentId: 'S000', studentName: 'Ignacio de Paul', ... }

=== Final Students Array ===
[ ... ]
```

# Important Rules

1. You must use all 8 required array methods:

```text
forEach
filter
find
map
push
pop
shift
unshift
```

2. Do not use a `for...of` loop for this exercise.

3. Do not simply print the array without using the required method.

4. Use clear `console.log()` section titles so your output is easy to read.

5. Make sure your file runs without errors using Node.js.

# Helpful Reminder

## Methods that do not directly change the original array

```text
forEach
filter
find
map
```

## Methods that change the original array

```text
push
pop
shift
unshift
```

## Return values

| Method    | What it does               | What it returns           |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `forEach` | Runs code for each item    | `undefined`               |
| `filter`  | Keeps matching items       | New array                 |
| `find`    | Finds first matching item  | One object or `undefined` |
| `map`     | Transforms each item       | New array                 |
| `push`    | Adds item to the end       | New array length          |
| `pop`     | Removes last item          | Removed item              |
| `shift`   | Removes first item         | Removed item              |
| `unshift` | Adds item to the beginning | New array length          |
